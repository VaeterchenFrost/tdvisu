----------

Visualization for [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) on [tree decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition).

Create a graph object for each given graph that is of interest for the dynamic programming.

The visualization generates highlights and adds solution-tables for user defined time steps.

These snapshot of the graphs will be written in a graphviz-supported file-format to a folder of your choosing.

For the portable and light weight '.svg' format, all graphs for a timestep can be joined together to provide a thoroughly view on the process of dynamic programming.

With the '.svg' format the images are highly customizable, and even combining several timesteps together using svg [animate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/animate) would be an option in the future.

# Using
[Alubbock:Graphviz](https://anaconda.org/alubbock/graphviz) (or [Graphviz (>=2.38)](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/))

[python-benedict](https://pypi.org/project/python-benedict/)

[for dpdb: psycopg2 (2.8.5)](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/index.html)

----------

# To register the graphviz plugins
https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/1352
```shell
dot.exe -c
```

# To install

In a command prompt with pip (to get *pip* see: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed:
Just run
```shell
pip install -h (for more information on install options)
pip install tdvisu
```

To download the latest version from the default branch:
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --single https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
```

# To isolate the dependencies

With [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html ) on the system installed you can isolate the environment, for example
```shell
virtualenv tdvisu_dir -p 3.8
cd tdvisu_dir/bin/
source activate
```
With [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) on the system installed the dependencies for this project can be automatically installed in a new environment:

Go to the projects base directory.

Open a *conda-command-prompt* with admin privileges and run the commands from the project folder
- to create a new environment with basic dependencies:
```shell
conda env create -f .\environment.yml
```
- to activate the environment:
```shell
conda activate tdvisu
```

# Install from source

To clone the complete repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
```

To download only the latest version from the default branch:
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --single https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu
```

To install the project from the source folder:
```shell
pip install -h (for more information on install options)
pip install .
```
to confirm that the visualization finds all dependencies:
```shell
python .\tdvisu\visualization.py -h
```
to run all tests:
```shell
pip install .[test] 
pytest .\test\
```

----------

# How to use

The visualization needs input in the form of the [Json API](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/gpusat-VISU/blob/master/JsonAPI_v1.3.md).
The creation of this file is exemplary implemented in *construct_dpdb_visu.py* or the fork [GPUSAT](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/GPUSAT) and *--visufile filename* (optionally disabling preprocessing with *-p*).

Run the python file with the above dependencies installed:
[visualization.py](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/gpusat-VISU/blob/master/satvisualization_repo/satvisu/visualization.py)

**visualization.py** takes two parameters, the json-**infile** to read from, and optionally one **outputfolder**.
With both arguments a call from IPython might look like this:

```python
runfile('visualization.py', 
args='visugpusat.json examplefolder')
```

For #SAT it produces for example three different graphs suffixed with a running integer to represent timesteps:

+ *TDStep* the tree decomposition with solved nodes
+ *PrimalGraphStep* the primal graph with currently active variables highlighted
+ *IncidenceGraphStep* the bipartite incidence graph with active clauses/variables highlighted

The graphs are images encoded in resolution independent **.svg files** (see https://www.lifewire.com/svg-file-4120603)

## How to use construct_dpdb_visu.py
After installing the project [dp_on_dbs](https://github.com/hmarkus/dp_on_dbs) with the there listed [requirements](https://github.com/hmarkus/dp_on_dbs#requirements), we need to
- edit the [database.ini](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu/blob/master/tdvisu/database.ini) with our password to [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Solve a problem with `python dpdb.py [GENERAL-OPTIONS] -f <INPUT-FILE> <PROBLEM> [PROBLEM-SPECIFIC-OPTIONS]`
  - for the problem **VertexCover** 
    - with flag `--gr-file` to store the htd Input (if the input was in a different format)
  - for the problem **SharpSat**
    - with flag `--store-formula` to store the formula in the database
- Run 
  - **Sat** / **SharpSat**: `python construct_dpdb_visu.py [PROBLEMNUMBER]`
  - **VertexCover**: `python construct_dpdb_visu.py [PROBLEMNUMBER] --twfile [TWFILE]` 
   with the file in DIMACS tw-format containing the edges of the graph.

# Installation of the psycopg2 package 

See https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites

For example on linux today this might need
`sudo apt install libpq-dev` 
before completion.

-----------------

# New Release

## Version
- Bump `/version.py` according to the changes made
- Change date to the release day, keep format 

## Requirements
In case dependencies have changed, or just to update some, check
- *requirements.txt*
- *stable-requirements.txt* (using `pip freeze`)
- *setup.py*

## Write Changelog.md
- Add tag with link (see bottom for linking examples)
- Add changes, maybe some are already in *Unreleased*
- Update *Unreleased* with **(No) unreleased changes**

## Review code
- Run tests (pytest)
- Check codestyle (pylint)

## Push
- Push changes to master
- Wait for all automated checks! (All checks have passed...)

## Create Release
- On the GitHub page go to: Release, **[Draft a new release](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu/releases/new )** 
- Enter v'YOUR VERSION NUMBER' as the tag.
- Add a **Release Title** (could be just the version)
- Add some description (like in the CHANGELOG.md)
- Click on **Publish release** on the bottom

## Should automatically release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tdvisu/ )
- For details see: [Upload Python Package](https://github.com/VaeterchenFrost/tdvisu/blob/master/.github/workflows/python-app.yml )

**Now you are set for the new release :tada:**
